## 🛠 Usage

### Add a new alias
```sh
poyo add <key> "<command>"
```
Example:
```sh
poyo add ll "ls -lah"
```

### Run an alias
```sh
poyo run <key>
```
Example:
```sh
poyo run ll
```
(Executes `ls -lah`)

### List all aliases
```sh
poyo list
```

```

poyo update ll "ls -l"
```

### Delete an alias
```sh
poyo delete <key>
```

poyo delete ll
```

### Place Holders and Dynamic Values
You can use placeholders in your commands to make them more dynamic. Poyo will prompt you to enter values for these placeholders if they are present in the command and users don't provide them while running the alias.

```sh
poyo add greet "echo 'Hello {name}, welcome to {place}!'"

poyo run greet name=Alice place=Wonderland
```
(Executes `echo 'Hello Alice, welcome to Wonderland!'`)

or 

```sh
poyo run greet
```
(Will prompt you to enter values for `{name}` and `{place}`)
```sh
Enter value for 'name': Alice
Enter value for 'place': Wonderland
```
(Executes `echo 'Hello Alice, welcome to Wonderland!'`)


## 📌 Phase 2 Enhancements
